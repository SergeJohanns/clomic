To use this bot you only need two commands. '/feeds' gives you a list of all of
the content feeds the host has implemented. Try it now and see if I have what
you're looking for. '/subscribe' is what you use to actually subscribe to
content. For instance '/subscribe xkcd' if you want to recieve new xkcd comics.
